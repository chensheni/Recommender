# Recommender

This is the Capstone of Java Programming in Coursera. The database used in this project is moving data and rating data. The recommendation is based on: (0) new user rates 12 movies from 0 to 10. (1) finding the most similar users using the dot product (because we also care about the magnitude) (2) calculating the weighted score for each movie  = importance of the rater * his/ her rating (3) only showing the first 10 movies that have the highest weighted rating.
